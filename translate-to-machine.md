# Translate Human language to Machine code


Human language is about the requirements, to ask a program to implement some functions.


The machine doesn't have the ability to communicate with humans.

For a high-level machine called **Computer** which can only understand binary data like 0 and 1.

So computer experts find a way to let humans interact with the computer.

That way called **the Input and Ouput Methods**.

We input data and the computer output another data, then we reach the purpose.

As a computer user, the user will not directly touch with hardware.
Because the barrier is huge.

We know the hardware is commonly such as CPU, Memory, Disk, Peripherals etc.

Operating System will try to communicate with hardwares.
And usually, one OS can support countless type of hardwares.

So the application developer can communicate with hardwares through OS layer. 
the OS layer API is frequnetly more friendly, more easy to use.

## Machine-Language

Machine lanugage is point to assembly lang, which is mnemonic for binary code, so it is too native to use.

Having many ASM(assembly) code can interact with CPU register.

In Embedded Machine, the common way to control CPU is to change the value of many registers. the register is a place for CPU to store often 32-bit or 64-bit binary data.

CPU can know what it should to do by continuously reading the value of the register.
One register represents one function provided by CPU.


## High-level programming Language

Because it is too detail-oriented for operating registers.
Computer Experts have invented the high-level language to reduce the code length to implement a function.

code is getting shorter, and coder can only remember a few keywords to implement a complicated functon.
